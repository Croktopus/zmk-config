conda create -n zmk python=3.8 anaconda

conda install protobuf

deb http://cz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic main universe


sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
>   build-essential \
>   curl \
>   wget \
>   file \
>   libxdo-dev \
>   libssl-dev \
>   libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
>   librsvg2-dev
